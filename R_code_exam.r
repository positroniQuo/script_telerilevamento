# It is also a part of the Natura2000 network, and a very important wet area fot migratory birds and local fauna ( link: https://www.comune.rimini.it/servizi/ambiente/aree-naturali-protette).
# However, direct observations showed a complete drought of the area in recent times, which nullifies the above mentioned functions of the area.
# To have a better idea of what may have happened, it could be useful to analyse recent data (2015-2022) and search for patterns of change.
# Since july is the dryest month of the year locally (link: https://it.climate-data.org/europa/italia/emilia-romagna/rimini-1176/), 
# it will be the month from which images will be analysed.
# Data include all the 10 mts resolution bands avaiable: RGB and NIR.
