# This code processes landsat 7 ETM+ (landsat 2 - collection 2) images of the in.cal system, an abandoned quarry repurposed to be a natural reserve,
# water storage and floodplain area near Rimini, next to the Marecchia river(link: https://albopretorio.comune.rimini.it/web/trasparenza/papca-ap?p_

# It is also a part of the Natura2000 network, and a very important wet area fot migratory birds and local fauna ( link: https://www.comune.rimini.it/servizi/ambiente/aree-naturali-protette).
# However, direct observations showed a complete drought of the area in recent times, which nullifies the above mentioned functions of the area.
# To have a better idea of what may have happened, it could be useful to analyse recent data (00s-21s) and search for patterns.
# Since july is the dryest month of the year locally (link: https://it.climate-data.org/europa/italia/emilia-romagna/rimini-1176/)
# the first 6 bands of landsat images taken in july have been downloaded and included in this analysis.

# abrupt end
# reasons:
# resolution is not fine enought for such little area.
# switching to sentinel images with 10m resolution, 3x as much.
