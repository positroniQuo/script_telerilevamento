# Practice for exam

# First we need a package to operate with raster data. For this we install the "raster" package

install.packages("raster")

# Then we need a working directory for our code, data and outputs to go, so we create one eand we set it to be used by this code

setwd("C:/lab_2/")

# Let's import our first landsat raster image. To do this we use the "brick" function, that imports the image with all layers

l2011 <- brick("p224r63_2011.grd")

# Lest's check how the import went

l2011

# Now we look at the actual image: one of the easyest options is to use the "plot"  function

plot(l2011)
