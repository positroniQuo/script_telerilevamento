# Water absorbs most of the NIR radiation

# The DVI, or Difference Vegetation Index, is useful to visualize vegetation in an area, 
# since tipically the ground absorbs less PAR (Photosintetically Active Radiation) and more NIR radiation, and vice versa for plant-covered areas,
# thought this is not always the case (for example this is generally more true for wet soils rather than dry ones), and it is prone to interferences as clouds.
# The DVI is simply calculated subtracting values for the red reflecance from the NIR one in every pixel, they have values that range from 0 to 255 in these images (being 8 bit).
# The DVI is found writing it as an equation

dvi1992 = l1992[[1]] - l1992[[2]]
# or:
# dvi1992 = l1992$defor1_.1 - l1992$defor1_.2

# We can now visualize the values obtained

dvi1992

cl <- colorRampPalette(c('darkblue','yellow','red','black'))(100)
plot(dvi1992, col=cl)

# Repeating the procedure with the other image from 2006

dvi2006 = l2006[[1]] - l2006[[2]]

# Besides having a visual on the vegetation cover, we can use this simple index to also compare images.
# I will now visualize calculate the difference between the two indexes

# As we can see this can be very useful in this case, but there are limits:
# we cannot effectively compare two DVI images with different resolutions, since values would not be compatible.
# To deal with this problem a much more useful, yet still simple index can be used.
# The NDVI (N is for normalized) is calculated with this formula:
# NDVI = DVI / NIR reflectance + Red reflectance
# The value obtained ranges from -1 to +1, therefore becomes comparable between other images taken in different resolutions

# There is a shortcut to many useful indexes that can be used, thought when doing so some results may be offset if corrections 
# aren't made when imputing the image when needed.
