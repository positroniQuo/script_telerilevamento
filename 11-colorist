# EXAMPLE 1: MAPPING A DISTRIBUTION OF SPECIES IN THE ANNUAL CYCLE

# Here, we use eBird status and trend aggregate data for Field Sparrow (Spizella pusilla) to illustrate a different strategy for creating annual cycle maps, which leverages continuous occurrence data to describe where and when viewers might be able to find a species.

# Load the example using the data function
# Colorist only works with rasterstack items

data("fiespa_occ")
fiespa_occ

# To use the rasterbrick in analyses' we first have to calculate its metrics, to standardize into intensity values the raster data.

met1<-metrics_pull(fiespa_occ) #This function transforms rasterstack values describing individual distributions or species distributions into standardized intensity values.

print(met1)

# We want to choose a palette that helps communicate temporal information about the occurrence of Field Sparrow.
# We will use the palette_timecycle () function because our data represent an ordered and cyclic sequence (all months of the year)


pal<- palette_timecycle(fiespa_occ)

#we use head () to return the first values. "Pal" has 1212 objects, with head for example we take the first 6

head(pal)  

# We have seen how the palette_timecycle function returns us a data frame with three fields: specificy layer_id and color
#The specificity and layer_id fields will be used to assign colors to specific raster cells

# Now we can create a map.

# With the map_multiples () function we will be able to see the map for each layer, therefore for each month of the year
# Inside the parenthesis we will write 1.) The metric / 2.) The palette used / 3.) ncol = x to define the number of columns to display / 4.) Labels = names (filename)

map_multiples(met1, pal, ncol = 3, labels = names (fiespa_occ))

# If we want to extract a month of data for deeper analysis, we can use map_single () and specify which month of data we would like to see using the layer argument.

map_single(met1, pal, layer = 6)

# To generate a single annual cycle map that summarizes space-time information on the occurrence of Field Sparrow, 
# we need to "distill" the distributive information into our RasterStack, so we can use metrics_distill ()
# The metrics_distill () function calculates distribution metrics on all levels in each raster cell and returns three metrics for later viewing:
# -Maximum intensity (that is, the maximum value of occurrence, abundance, or density).
# -Maximum intensity layer (hence the identity of the layer containing the maximum intensity value)
# -Specificity of the maximum intensity value for the maximum intensity layer (hence the degree to which the intensity values are unevenly distributed between the layers).

met1_distill<-metrics_distill(fiespa_occ) # we can distill the information
map_single(met1_distill,pal) #We then display the information in the single image with the "distilled" images and the palette created previously


# Finally we create the legend.
# previously we used the palette_timecycle () function and consequently we will use the legend_timecycle () function to display the legend
# R will return a legend with circles.
# Information about when the time cycle begins (and ends) can also be provided in the "origin_label" argument.

legend_timecycle(pal, origin_label = "jan 1")


# CONCLUSIONS
# With all the information described, with the map and with the legend, we are able to understand where and when to find this species.
# The more colored parts will indicate high specificity but high probability of occurrence only at certain times of the year
# The gray parts, on the other hand, will indicate low specificity but high occurrence throughout the year
# In this case, low specificity indicates seasonality where 0 indicates presence all year round




#EXAMPLE 2: MAPPING INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIOR OVER TIME


#Here we explore how a Fisher individual (Pekania pennanti), who lives in upstate New York, moved into his local environment over a period of nine sequential nights in 2011.

#Load the data

data("fisher_ud")   

fisher_ud

# Extract the information from the Rasterstack

m2<-metrics_pull(fisher_ud)

m2

#Create the palette, this time we use the palette_timeline function because unlike the previous example, they describe a linear and non-cyclic sequence

pal2<-palette_timeline(fisher_ud)

head(pal2)

# We create maps (9, one for each day) that will describe the position of the individual in each day

map_multiples(m2,ncol = 3, pal2)

# It often happens that maps are faded.
# The lambda_i parameter in map_multiples () and map_single () allows users to visually adjust the relative weights of high and low intensity values.
# In this case we want to reduce the disparity between high and low intensity values so we set the value to -5.
# We will see that the lower the lambda_i value, the more intense the color will be

map_multiples(m2,ncol = 3, pal2, lambda_i = -5)

# At this point we can distill the information
# It is important to remember that specificity values (and the resulting display of specificity values) for Fisher must be interpreted differently than for Field Sparrow.
# Here, specificity values indicate the degree to which the individual used the same locations within the landscape for nine nights. Low specificity suggests consistent use over time.

m2_distill<-metrics_distill(fisher_ud)

map_single(m2_distill,pal2,lambda_i = -5)

# We used linear values so we will use legend_timeline and not legend_timecycle
# In this case we can use time_labels to determine the investigation period.

legend_timeline(pal2,time_labels = c("2 aprile", "11 aprile"))

# EXAMPLE 3: MAPPING THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF MULTIPLE INDIVIDUALS DURING THE SAME TIME PERIOD

# In the previous examples, we explored the distributions of a single species and a single individual over multiple time periods.
#colorist can also be used to explore the distribution of multiple species or individuals in a single period of time.

#Here, we use GPS tracking data collected from African elephants (Loxodonta africana) in Etosha National Park (Namibia) during 2011 to explore how two individuals used the landscape over the course of a year.

#Load the data

data("elephant_ud")

elephant_ud

# Extract the data from the Rasterstack

met3<-metrics_pull(elephant_ud)

# Here we encounter another function, palette_set ()
# We use this function when we have an unordered set (they don't fit into linear or cyclic sequences)

pal3<-palette_set(elephant_ud)

# We can Create the multiple maps and then we will see the two samples, we use "labels" to extract the names present in the Rasterstack

map_multiples(met3, pal3, ncol = 2,lambda_i = -5,labels = names(elephant_ud))

# The usage distributions for LA11 and LA14 look remarkably similar at first glance, which is not surprising given that the two elephants belong to the same herd.
# However, we can more clearly understand the similarities and differences in how they used space in 2011 by “distilling” the distributional information from the two raster layers with metrics_distill () and visualizing the resulting metrics with map_single ().

# WE SHOULD RE-CALIBRATE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE MEANING OF SPECIFICITY

# We stand in contrast to the Field Sparrow and Fisher examples, where specificity indicated the degree to which intensity values were inconsistent (or consistent) over time.
# HERE WE CAN DEFINE IT AS A DIFFERENTIAL LANDSCAPE MEASURE.
# THEREFORE LOW SPECIFICITY IS EQUAL TO COMMON USE OF THE LANDSCAPE, HIGH SPECIFICITY INDICATES A DIFFERENTIAL USE OF THE LANDSCAPE

met3_distt<-metrics_distill(elephant_ud)
map_single(met3_distt,pal2,lambda_i = -5)

# Here we will use a different legend once again.
# We will use legend_set and not legend_timeline or legend_timecycle 

legend_set(pal3, group_labels = names(elephant_ud))
