# This exercize is about Similaun glacier Sentinel data (location where Otzi was found)
# There is a multitude of surfaces that reflects different ranges of wavelenghts




# Viridis is a package containing palettes of colours specifically made for inclusivity in data analisys, since distinguishable from people with daltonism/other colour related eye disfunctions

library(RStoolbox) # Sourse of the focal function we are going to use later

sen <- brick("sentinel.png")

# Sentinel images have the following bands arrangement:
# 1 : NIR 
# 2 : Red
# 3 : Green

ggRGB(sen, 1, 2, 3) # Stretch is linear by default

g1 <- ggRGB(sen, 1, 2, 3)
g2 <- ggRGB(sen, 2, 1, 3) # NIR becomes green, so vegetation wil be showcased accordingly

g1+g2 # Patchwork doing its magic: easy way to arrange graphics alongside each other

g1/g2 # Graphics on top of each other

# I want to have a general idea of the variability in reflectance in the image for the NIR wavelenghts
# It can be obtained via standard deviation.
#  First of all i assign an object with only the NIR band

nir <- sen[[1]]

# The focal function does an operation on matrixes of points of specified dimentions, reporting the modified data as output.
# I apply a standard deviation function ("fun=sd") on "nir" following a pattern of matrixes of 9 (3x3) pixels.
# The function literally cicles on all the image with a "for" cycle until all pixels are analyzed.
# The bigger the matrix, the more information gets summarized into bigger units, the less details i'll obtain.
# The matrixes must be of odd numbers

sd3 <- focal(nir, matrix(1/9, 3, 3), fun=sd)

clsd <- colorRampPalette(c('blue','green','pink','magenta','orange','brown','red','yellow'))(100)

plot(sd3, col=clsd)

# We go from low variabilities (blue) to high ones (red-yellowish)

# To use ggplot we have to open an empty layer ("ggplot()") then specifyng what to put in it and it's a e s t e t h i c s
# Layer fills the plot with the data we found earlyer
# "ggtitle" gives a main to the plot, while we use viridis for the colour.
# here are 3 alternatives
